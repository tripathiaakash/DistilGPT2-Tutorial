The only reason i was scared is because if they didn't have a director, they would've done the same. I'm not a big fan of any actors, but this movie is one of the better ones. The acting is very good, and the dialogue is nice. The script is always very touching and it makes my heart feel fresh. Overall it was a good movie. \",\n",
              " 'this is still a problem. I read this from the review and found it out.<br /><br />I am a woman who is tired of seeing this horror flick. Although its a very bad movie i do think it is really bad and this movie is definitely worth watching. ',\n",
              " \"this is, of course, bad. I also like watching a movie with an audience. The actors were all wasted, but if I had a screenwriting opportunity, I would have liked to see more like this, but the director was stupid. He was an idiot, but that being said, I really don't care. And I get the feeling from watching this. \",\n",
              " \"this is not good for this film. It shows the constant desire for beauty, the horror of the past, and the terror of the future. There is nothing sexy about this film. It feels weird to watch one of my favorite movies of all time and try not to be nauseating in the way this film is. It is frightening. It even resembles a film from the nineties, where I was in college. I watched the first twenty-one minutes, which was all better than the twenty-one. I was terrified that I would get bored of the film if it didn't do anything about it, even if they were good. There are no sexual features. There are no sex scenes whatsoever.<br /><br />It's not a good movie. It's a depressing film, a wretched film. I can't imagine if this would be a good film, or worse, a pathetic movie. It seems as though the director should have made better movies, like this one. This is just stupid. Its silly. The plot is all on the basis of people pretending to be bad. The plot is simply stupid. The end is like a high school football game with no special place on the field. It is so absurd. We will never see a film like this again. I watched it for twenty years. I have seen it all but four times.<br /><br />I was in high school with the third grade when it was my first film. My teacher watched it once. I feel it is that pointless. It is stupid. I don't think I have ever seen it before. I don't know if it's a substitute for film classes.<br /><br />No, I was scared. I was scared because I wasn't allowed to get off the football field. It felt like I was being watched a bunch of random males.<br /><br />I didn't really feel that I was allowed to do anything. It just felt like I was being shown a movie, but I couldn't figure out anything about it. The acting was terrible. It seemed as though the young people in this film were all in a similar fashion as they were watching it. \",\n",
              " \"this is the worst film I have ever seen - it looks like someone could have made an action flick - because it has always been an action flick, which would have ended there. By the time I saw this one, I knew I was not alone in my dislike of this film. I had never seen the first time I saw this and I was not alone when it came to this. I usually don't see this sort of movie - in the first few months of the film (either in the film itself or in a few other scenes). If you want to watch it, you'll need to understand why this was supposed to be such a bad movie. But here's what I did after watching the first one: A violent sub-plot and ending that was neither good nor stupid. \"]"
